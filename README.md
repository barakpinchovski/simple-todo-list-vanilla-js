# simple-todo-list-vanilla-js
A todo list app in vanilla JS: A simple implementation in pure, plain Javascript (no tricks).

I created it originally as an example for JS - DOM manipulation for my students at BGU, and I may improve it later on.

## Notice
I initially didn't intend to perform or prevent any XSS or any JS injections in this implementation.  
Be aware of that if you plan to use this code on staging/production (not recommended without implementing counter-XSS measures).
